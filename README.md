# Look Zoom

## Grid Connect

### ToDo List

- Possibly make the prev/next buttons in the carousel raw html instead of images (able to apply better css effects this way)
- When focused on search input, darker highlight has weird border radius
- Logo on mobile could be sized a bit better
- Do we need the notice area on mobile? If so, what should it look like? The same? Worried about the "X" button being too small
- Drop down on main menu, what does it look like?
- Are there click or hover effects on the buttons or links?
